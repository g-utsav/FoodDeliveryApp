###  We have created REST API's with the help of SpringBoot. This is our Consrtuct Week project at Masai School ,Basically in masai school after every  four week we have to build project on basis of whatever learned in last four weeks.

## Setup
###  There are various ways to use spring boot to develop a spring application: 

-  1. Installing STS software
-  2. installing the STS plugin in normal eclipse software
-  3. By using the Spring initializer website
-  4. By using Maven or Gradle application.
-  5. By using Spring Boot CLI (Command Line interface)
